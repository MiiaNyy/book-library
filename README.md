# book-library

One of the projects in the Odin Project course.

Main goal of this project was to practice making and modifying objects.
Assigments was to create a book library, where user can add books, that they have read, want to read or are in progress of reading.

When books are added to the library, they can change the reading status in that particular book or remove it altogether from the library.

This was my first project using objects.
